# SmartSites Website Builder Prompt v3

## IMPORTANT: ATTACHED BRD FILE

I am attaching `smartsites-brd-v32.2 (3).md` to this session. This is the **single source of truth** for:
- All pricing (tiers, setup fees, monthly costs)
- Product definitions and features
- Navigation structure and sitemap
- Services with Problem → Solution → Outcome
- Compliance requirements
- Go-to-market strategy

**Use the BRD for all business logic, pricing, and product details. Do NOT use any styling or design guidance from the BRD. Design is your job.**

## YOUR ROLE

You are building EverIntentSmartSites.com, a marketing website for a web agency that sells professional websites and business automation to local service businesses (HVAC, plumbers, roofers, contractors, etc.).

**Your design philosophy:** Expertise through clarity, not flash. We prove we're good at websites BY having a good website. Not by showing off. Not by being trendy. By being clear, beautiful, and trustworthy.

---

## THE BALANCE WE NEED

### We ARE:
- **Problem solvers** — Every section answers "what's in it for me?"
- **Competent professionals** — Clean, polished, clearly knows what they're doing
- **Approachable experts** — Not intimidating, not talking down to anyone
- **Trustworthy** — Transparent pricing, real portfolio, honest claims
- **Modern** — Current design sensibilities, not dated or templated

### We ARE NOT:
- **Award chasers** — No design-for-design's-sake
- **Chest pounders** — No "we're the best" without proof
- **Template users** — Must feel custom and intentional
- **Trend followers** — No gimmicks that will look dated in 6 months
- **Enterprise cosplayers** — Our customers are small business owners, not Fortune 500

## VISUAL DESIGN DIRECTION

### Overall Feel:
Think of a really good local business that clearly has their act together. Professional without being corporate. Confident without being arrogant. The website equivalent of a contractor who shows up on time, in a clean truck, with the right tools.

### Color & Typography:
- Choose a palette that feels trustworthy and professional
- Primary accent should feel action-oriented (for CTAs)
- Typography should be highly readable, not decorative
- Strong hierarchy between headlines, body, and supporting text

### Layout Principles:
- Generous whitespace — let content breathe
- Clear visual hierarchy — eyes know where to go
- Purposeful sections — every block earns its place
- Mobile-first — 70% of visitors are on phones

### Imagery Requirements:

**USE UNSPLASH IMAGES:**
- Real service business owners (diverse, authentic, not stock-cheesy)
- People working: on phones, at job sites, with customers
- Clean, well-lit, modern photography
- Mix of portrait and environmental shots

**Suggested Unsplash searches:**
- "contractor phone" 
- "small business owner"
- "plumber working"
- "service technician"
- "business owner laptop"
- "handyman professional"

**VIDEO (use sparingly):**
- One hero video max (ambient, 10-15 seconds, looped, muted)
- Could be: hands typing, phone notifications, service work
- Purpose: adds life without distraction
- NOT required on every page — only if it adds value

**What to avoid in imagery:**
- Stock photo "business handshake" vibes
- Overly diverse casting that feels forced
- Tech-bro/startup aesthetics
- Anything that screams "template"

## WHAT DRAWS USERS IN

These business owners have been burned before. They've paid agencies that ghosted them. They've tried DIY builders and wasted weekends. They need to feel three things fast:

### 1. "These people get it"
Show you understand their problems before pitching solutions. Name the pain:
- Competitors rank higher on Google
- Missed calls go to voicemail (and customers don't leave messages)
- Current website looks amateur or doesn't exist
- No time to figure out marketing tech

### 2. "This is actually affordable"
Price is visible early. Not hidden behind "contact us." Specific numbers build trust:
- "$249 to start"
- "5 days to launch"
- "You own everything"

### 3. "They can actually deliver"
Proof over promises:
- Real portfolio with links to live sites
- Specific outcomes, not vague benefits
- Testimonials from similar businesses
- The site itself as evidence of competence

1. **Plain language.** "Website" not "digital presence"
2. **Short sentences.** 15 words max
3. **Benefit-first.** "Get found on Google" not "SEO optimization"
4. **Specific proof.** "$249" not "affordable"
5. **No em dashes.** Use commas or periods

7. **Second person.** "You" and "Your" throughout

## THE TEST

When a plumber in Phoenix lands on this site from a Craigslist ad, within 10 seconds they should:

1. **Understand:** "They build websites for businesses like mine"
2. **Believe:** "They seem legit, not scammy"
3. **Know the price:** "$249 to start, that's doable"
4. **See proof:** "Those are real sites they built"
5. **Feel safe:** "I'm not going to get ripped off"
6. **Know what to do:** "Click Get Started"

That's the job. Beautiful, clear, trustworthy, and converting.

## BUILD ORDER

1. **Homepage** — This sets the tone for everything
2. **Pricing** — Where decisions happen
3. **Beautiful Websites** — Hero service page
4. **Our Work** — Proof we deliver
5. **Service pages** — SEO and depth
6. **Checkout flows** — Conversion completion

---

## START HERE

Build the homepage first. Make it beautiful. Make it clear. Make it convert.

Remember: We're not trying to win a design award. We're trying to help a busy contractor trust us enough to spend $249. That's a very different job.

The best design for this is invisible. The visitor doesn't think "nice website." They think "I need this."

Go.
