# SmartSites Market Research & Product Alignment

**Date:** December 20, 2025  
**Sources:** ChatGPT BRD Review, Independent Market Research, Persona Spec  
**Purpose:** Align product/service structure with how local businesses actually buy

---

## Executive Summary

Local service businesses don't buy "website packages" — they buy **solutions to problems**. This document synthesizes market research with persona buying behavior to recommend a product structure that:

1. **Leads with products** (what they're buying) not tiers (what we're selling)
2. **Matches buyer search intent** ("I need SEO" not "I need T3")
3. **Captures the missing middle** ($2,500-$4,500 gap between T4 and Custom)
4. **Creates multiple revenue streams** (packages, standalone products, usage, discovery)

---

## Part 1: How Target Personas Actually Buy

### Buying Triggers (From Persona Spec)

External personas 2-3 (Business Owner, Needs Help prospect) don't wake up thinking "I need a T2 package." They experience **trigger events**:

| Trigger Event | What They Say | What They Search |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| Lost deal to competitor | "Their website looked more professional" | "web design for [industry]" |
| Slow month | "I'm not getting enough calls" | "how to get more leads" |
| Bad review | "My Google rating dropped" | "reputation management" |
| Missed calls | "I can't answer my phone when I'm working" | "missed call text back" |
| Schedule chaos | "I'm double-booked again" | "online booking for [industry]" |

**Key insight:** They search for **products/solutions**, not tier comparisons.

### Decision Criteria (Research-Backed)

| Factor | Weight | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Does this solve my specific problem? | High | Forrester B2B Buying |
| Can I afford it? | High | Survey data |
| Do I trust this company? | Medium | Online reviews/portfolio |
| Is pricing clear? | Medium | 64% confused by web pricing |
| Can I start small and grow? | Medium | Subscription preference |

## Part 4: Package Recommendations

### 4.1 Updated Package Names

Current tier names are internal-facing. Proposed names describe outcomes:

| Current | Proposed | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| T1 Smart Site | **Starter Site** | Clear entry point |
| T2 Smart Lead | **Lead Booster** | Describes primary outcome |
| T3 Smart Business | **Booking & Reputation** | Names key features |
| T4 Smart Growth | **AI Growth** | Emphasizes AI differentiation |

### 4.2 Smart Launch (New Package)

**Problem:** Gap between T4 ($497/mo recurring) and Custom ($5k+ one-time).

Buyers in this gap:
- Need more than a template website
- Want a "launch" experience with quick wins
- Can afford a project fee + reasonable ongoing
- Not ready for full custom agency relationship

**Smart Launch: $2,500-$4,500 one-time + $297/mo ongoing**

| Component | Included |
|-----------|----------|
| Website | Custom 10-page design (not template) |
| Brand | Photography consultation + style guide |
| Local Presence | Google Business Profile optimization |
| Marketing Sprint | 90-day SEO + Google Ads setup |
| Ongoing | Booking & Reputation tier features |

**Revenue model:** One-time project + monthly retainer = hybrid model that traditional agencies use successfully.

### 4.3 SmartStart Strategy Session

**Problem:** Current sales process has no paid qualification step.

Benefits:
- Generates revenue from sales process
- Filters serious buyers from tire-kickers
- Creates natural upsell opportunity
- Provides value even if they don't buy

**SmartStart: $500-$750**

| Deliverable | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Consultation | 60-minute strategy call |
| Audit | Website + marketing audit |
| Analysis | Competitive landscape review |
| Report | Custom recommendation document |
| Credit | Full amount credited toward any package |

**Revenue events per customer:** 1-2

### Proposed Model

## Part 6: Messaging Alignment

### Pain-First Headlines (ChatGPT Got This Right)

Each product page should lead with the problem:

| Product | Pain Headline | Solution Subhead |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Web Design | "Losing jobs because your website looks amateur?" | "Professional site in 5 days" |
| Local SEO | "Competitors showing up on Google. You're not." | "Get found when customers search" |
| Lead Capture | "Missing calls = missing revenue" | "Every lead gets a response" |
| Booking | "Phone tag is killing your schedule" | "Customers book online 24/7" |
| Reputation | "One bad review is costing you jobs" | "Build a 5-star reputation" |
| AI | "You can't be everywhere at once" | "Let AI handle the routine" |

### Tier Messaging on Pricing Page

Show tiers as bundles, not feature ladders:

| Tier | Bundle Description |
|------|-------------------|
| Starter Site | "Professional website to establish your online presence" |
| Lead Booster | "Website + never miss another lead" |
| Booking & Reputation | "Website + leads + online booking + 5-star reviews" |
| AI Growth | "Everything + AI handles calls and follow-ups for you" |

---

## Part 7: Implementation Recommendations

### Immediate (No Code)

1. Update pricing page copy to be outcome-oriented
2. Add "Most Popular" badge to T3 (Booking & Reputation)
3. Add Smart Launch package description to pricing page

### Near-Term (Content)

1. Create product-category landing pages (`/services/seo`, `/services/web-design`)
2. Each page: problem → solution → standalone pricing → which packages include it
3. Internal linking from service pages to relevant industry pages

### Medium-Term (Checkout)

1. Build standalone product checkout (SEO Sprint, Ads Management, Content Package)
2. Add Smart Launch to main checkout flow
3. Build SmartStart Strategy Session booking

### Longer-Term (Billing)

1. Usage-based billing for AI minutes beyond included
2. Multi-location pricing calculator
3. Annual billing discount option

## Part 8: What ChatGPT Got Right

1. ✅ Benefit-led messaging over feature lists
2. ✅ Pain-first headline structure
3. ✅ AI adoption statistics as differentiator (61% of SMBs use chatbots)
4. ✅ Subscription model advantages (predictable costs for SMBs)
5. ✅ Price anchoring strategy (show higher tier first)
6. ✅ Professional website = trust signal (97% check online before calling)

## Part 9: What ChatGPT Missed (And This Research Adds)

1. ❌ **The missing middle:** No bridge between T4 and Custom → Smart Launch
2. ❌ **Product-category pages:** Buyers search "SEO services" not "tier comparison"
3. ❌ **Standalone products:** Forces tier upgrades instead of targeted purchases
4. ❌ **Paid discovery:** No revenue from sales process → SmartStart Session
5. ❌ **Hybrid revenue model:** Current model is pure SaaS; traditional agencies use project + retainer
6. ❌ **Usage-based revenue:** AI minutes included in tiers, not sold separately
7. ❌ **Persona buying behavior:** Didn't connect tier structure to how buyers actually search
