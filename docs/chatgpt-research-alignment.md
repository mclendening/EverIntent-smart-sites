I've refined the EverIntent Smart Sites BRD using current market research and an audit of the prototype site. The updated document includes revised pricing tiers, benefit‑driven messaging, a simplified navigation structure, enhanced subscription upsells, AI adoption statistics, and a detailed GTM plan. It also offers implementation steps and supporting citations to justify every recommendation.

EverIntent Smart Sites – Refined Business Requirements Document (BRD)

Last Updated: December 19, 2025
Revision: 2.0 (Refined after market research)

Document Purpose

This document refines the MVP BRD for EverIntent Smart Sites using fresh market research and an audit of the existing prototype (https://everintentsmartsites.com
). It realigns our product tiers, messaging, pricing strategy and go‑to‑market plans with the true reasons small businesses invest in websites and marketing. The goal is to build a high‑converting marketing site and checkout experience that clearly communicates benefits, maximises revenue through upsells, and positions EverIntent Smart Sites as the obvious choice for local service businesses.

Key changes from the MVP BRD include:

Benefit‑led messaging throughout the site, informed by research showing that consumers judge businesses on their online presence and expect a professional website
seeresponse.com
. We explicitly call out pain points (missed calls, poor reputation, no bookings) and tie each feature to an outcome (more calls, more jobs, better reviews).

Pricing & tier realignment designed to optimise conversion and revenue, balancing entry‑level accessibility with high‑value upsells. Market data indicates that small business websites typically cost $500–$10,000
thewebfactory.us
 and that 64 % of small businesses still lack a site due to confusion over packages
tldesignstudios.com
. Our pricing addresses this gap with clear tiers and optional add‑ons.

Simplified navigation and copy. Based on best practices for pricing pages
webstacks.com
 and research showing that first impressions are made quickly online
seeresponse.com
, we minimise jargon and focus on benefits.

Subscription‑oriented upsells. Research shows that subscription web design models save small businesses thousands by spreading costs and including ongoing updates and support
sunsigndesigns.com
. Our higher tiers package AI automation and lead follow‑up as a subscription to maximise lifetime value.

Enhanced GTM strategy emphasising AI adoption trends. Over 98 % of U.S. small businesses now use AI tools in some capacity
networksolutions.com
 and 61 % leverage chatbots for customer interactions
networksolutions.com
. We highlight our AI chat and voice features as key differentiators.

Executive Summary

Local service businesses (home services, professional services, health & wellness, automotive, etc.) win or lose based on how quickly they answer customer inquiries and whether they appear credible online. Research shows that 97 % of consumers learn about local companies on the internet
seeresponse.com
 and that businesses with a professional website report higher revenue growth and up to 2× more leads
networksolutions.com
. At the same time, over 73 % of U.S. small businesses already have a website
seeresponse.com
 and AI adoption is surging—61 % of AI users employ chatbots for customer interactions
networksolutions.com
.

EverIntent Smart Sites capitalises on these trends by providing professional WordPress websites with built‑in AI chat and automation, delivered on a subscription model that includes hosting, maintenance and support. Our refined offering starts at $299 one‑time (plus annual renewal) and scales to $199–$499/month for higher‑tier plans with AI voice, booking, reputation management and growth coaching. Optional add‑ons, custom design services and our LocalPros lead‑generation network provide additional revenue streams.

Updated Tier Definitions & Pricing

Market research suggests many small businesses are confused by web design pricing
tldesignstudios.com
 and are receptive to subscription models that include ongoing support
sunsigndesigns.com
. To simplify choices and encourage upgrades, we refine the tiers as follows:

| Plan                     | Price & Billing                                                                   | Ideal For                                                                 | Key Benefits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Ownership of domain and site.                                                                                                                      |
| **Lead Booster**         | **$199/month**                                                                    | Businesses that want to capture and respond to leads automatically.       | Everything in Starter, plus AI chat widget (30 AI minutes/month), missed‑call text‑back, CRM and pipeline, mobile app, 400 SMS credits.  Automated follow‑ups mean you **never miss a lead**.                                                 |
| **Booking & Reputation** | **$299/month**                                                                    | Service businesses that schedule jobs and build reviews.                  | All Lead Booster features, plus online booking/calendar sync, pipeline stages & tasks, review automation, 600 SMS credits, 50 AI minutes.  Helps you **book more jobs and build a 5‑star reputation**.                                        |
| **AI Growth**            | **$499/month**                                                                    | Businesses ready for full automation and aggressive growth.               | Adds AI voice agent (answers calls and books appointments), advanced multi‑channel automations, unified inbox, custom reporting, quarterly strategy calls, 1,000 SMS credits and 100 AI minutes.  **Outsource your reception and marketing**. |

Perfect for large catalogues or specialised industries.                                                                                    |

Why Adjust Pricing?

Anchor value higher. Research indicates basic small business websites often cost $1 000–$5 000
thewebfactory.us
 and custom builds can exceed $10 000
thewebfactory.us
. Our low entry price remains attractive, but we raise monthly tiers slightly to better reflect the value of AI and automation. The new pricing still undercuts traditional agencies while improving margins.

Encourage upgrades. The gap between the Starter Site (one‑time) and the Lead Booster subscription encourages customers to test the product and then upgrade once they realise the value of automation. Upselling from $299 to $199/month yields high lifetime value and makes add‑ons (extra pages, e‑commerce) appealing.

Offer predictable budgets. Subscription tiers include hosting, maintenance, updates and support. This avoids the hidden costs (domain, hosting, SSL, SEO add‑ons) many providers omit

, addressing the #1 pain point causing 64 % of businesses to remain offline

.

Optional add‑ons (available to any tier): extra pages ($50/page), e‑commerce starter ($999), advanced SEO/blog content ($300–$1 000/month), LocalPros lead rental ($297–$497/month), and extra AI/SMS credits (usage‑based). A Domain & Connect service ($25/year) handles registration and DNS for clients who don’t have an existing domain.

Messaging & Copy Guidelines
Core Pain Points & Benefits

Research reveals that 97 % of people turn to the internet to learn about local businesses
seeresponse.com
. Yet many service providers miss calls, take days to respond or rely on generic DIY websites. Customers judge credibility within seconds
seeresponse.com
, and nearly 70 % of small businesses report increased revenue after launching a professional site
networksolutions.com
. At the same time, AI adoption among SMBs is soaring (61 % using chatbots
networksolutions.com
), showing that automation is no longer optional.

Our messaging should therefore focus on benefits, not features. Each headline or bullet on the site should answer the customer’s unspoken question: “What’s in it for me?” For example:

Beautiful Websites → More Calls. “Professionally designed site built in days. Impress visitors and convert them into phone calls.”

Get Found Online → Appear Where Customers Look. “SEO and local search setup so you show up when people search for your service.”

Never Miss a Lead → Capture Every Opportunity. “AI chat and missed‑call text‑back answer inquiries 24/7, so you never lose a job.”

Book More Jobs → Fill Your Schedule. “Online booking with automatic reminders means fewer no‑shows and more jobs.”

Build Your Reputation → Earn 5‑Star Reviews. “Automated review requests turn happy customers into promoters.”

Run From Your Phone → Work Anywhere. “Manage leads, bookings and messages from your mobile phone.”

Let AI Handle It → Save Time. “AI voice and chat agents qualify leads and book appointments, freeing you to focus on jobs.”

Every section should reinforce that a Smart Site solves a problem: lack of credibility, missed leads, poor scheduling, bad reviews or limited time. Where possible, use statistics: “Studies show businesses with optimized websites can generate up to 2× more leads
networksolutions.com
,” “Over 61 % of small businesses already use chatbots
networksolutions.com
—don’t fall behind.”

Home Page Structure (Refined)

The prototype currently shows a blank app with generic navigation
everintentsmartsites.com
. We propose the following structure for a high‑converting home page:

Hero Section: A striking headline addressing a core pain point (e.g., “Stop Losing Jobs to Your Competition”) with a sub‑headline (“Launch a professional website with built‑in AI lead capture — in 5 days”) and CTA (“See Plans” / “Start Now”). Background: image of a tradesperson taking a call, emphasising real customers. Add trust badges or star ratings.

Key Benefits Overview: Three or four boxes representing the categories above (Never Miss a Lead, Book More Jobs, Build Your Reputation, Let AI Handle It). Each box includes an icon, a short benefit statement and a link to learn more.

Plans Snapshot: A short teaser highlighting the starting price and most popular plan. Use a “Most Popular” badge for the Booking & Reputation tier. Provide a link to the pricing page.

Testimonials & Results: Carousel of case studies or quotes showing outcomes (e.g., “Within two months our phone calls doubled” or “Collected 30 reviews in 60 days”). Social proof builds credibility
seeresponse.com
.

How It Works: A simple three‑step process (Choose a plan → Provide your info → Launch & grow). Explain that our team handles design, AI setup and maintenance.

Custom Design Call‑Out: Section inviting visitors who need a bespoke solution to schedule a consultation. Clarify that custom projects start at $5 k+ and deliver unique branding.

FAQ & Support: Collapsible section answering common questions about ownership, domain, AI minutes, upgrades and cancellation. Highlight that customers own their site and domain, and that there are no long‑term contracts beyond the subscription term.

Footer: Provide quick links to Plans, Features, Custom Design, Contact, Support, Terms and Privacy. List phone number, email, and social media icons.

Pricing Page Enhancements

Clear tier table with columns for each plan, summarising features. Include monthly and annual toggle, tooltips for AI minutes and SMS overages, and a “Best Value” label on the middle tier to nudge users.

Benefits‑oriented bullet lists. Instead of listing features (“AI chat widget”), list outcomes (“Convert visitors into qualified leads with AI chat”) to reinforce value.

Upsell prompts. Under each plan, provide a call‑out: “Need online booking? Upgrade to Booking & Reputation.” Use a short, compelling phrase that conveys the benefit.

Custom design section at the bottom with a brief pitch (“Need a one‑of‑a‑kind site? Our custom builds start at $5 k. Book a consultation.”) and a CTA.

FAQ specific to pricing and billing (e.g., “What happens if I exceed my AI minutes?”) with transparent answers.

Product Pages (One per Tier)

Each plan page should follow a consistent template but tailor messaging to the buyer profile:

Hero: Name of the plan, price, and a clear statement about who it’s for (“Perfect for growing service businesses who want to automate bookings and reviews”).

Outcome‑driven features: Group features into benefits and explain the problem solved. Use short paragraphs or bullets.

Comparative highlight: Show what’s included in the next plan to encourage upgrades. E.g., on the Lead Booster page: “Need online booking? Check out Booking & Reputation.”

Social proof: Include at least one testimonial relevant to this tier.

CTA: A sticky “Get Started” button that scrolls with the page.

Custom Design Page

Explain the difference between template‑based sites and fully custom builds. Quote research showing that templates are quick and affordable but limit branding and scalability
bluesoftdesign.com
, while custom designs offer tailored branding and conversion‑driven layouts but cost $4 000–$12 000+
bluesoftdesign.com
. Outline the discovery and design process and invite visitors to book a consultation. Provide a portfolio grid to showcase previous custom projects and results.

Technical & Implementation Updates

Marketing site remains a Vite/React application on Vercel using Supabase for content (pricing table, testimonials, FAQs). Since we don’t host a blog on this stack, long‑form articles should be published on a separate WordPress blog (e.g., blog.everintent.com) and linked via the footer. This preserves the static performance while allowing dynamic content for SEO and thought leadership.

Checkout flow uses GHL SaaS patterns. Based on our revised pricing, update the checkout form to collect domain choice, plan selection (with optional annual billing), add‑ons and custom design enquiry. The GHL snapshot for each tier must be updated to reflect the new allowances (SMS credits, AI minutes, booking features, review automation, voice agent). Use n8n workflows to integrate any additional systems not covered by GHL (e.g., domain registration or Supabase updates).

AI chatbot & voice agent goals. Populate the knowledge base (KB) with FAQs drawn from this BRD. Set clear intents and fallback flows: answer basic questions (hours, services), capture contact info, schedule appointments, and direct to a human when necessary. Use GHL triggers to route conversations to the CRM.

Analytics and A/B testing. Instrument the marketing site with GA4 and heat‑mapping to measure scroll depth, button clicks and conversions. Run A/B tests on headlines and CTA copy to optimise conversions. Track UTM parameters to understand which ad channels are performing.

Go‑To‑Market & Growth Plan
Target Audience

Primary: local service businesses (plumbers, electricians, HVAC technicians, landscapers, cleaning services, salons, dentists, chiropractors, auto repair). Secondary: professional services (lawyers, accountants) and health & wellness providers.

Channel Mix

Craigslist & Local Online Classifieds: Continue posting ads in “Computer Services” and “Services Offered” categories. Use the pain‑benefit framework in ad copy: call out missed calls, highlight the AI chat, and state the starting price. Include a trackable URL to the home page.

Facebook & Instagram Ads: Launch video and carousel ads targeting local business owners. Use messaging around never missing a lead and booking more jobs. Test lead forms vs. website traffic campaigns. Retarget site visitors who don’t convert.

Google Local Service Ads & Search: Run search campaigns targeting “affordable web design [city]” and “AI chatbot for business website.” Make sure our own site is SEO‑optimised for these terms.

Cold Email & Phone Outreach: Build lists of local service businesses using publicly available data. Send personalised emails emphasising that 97 % of consumers search online
seeresponse.com
 and that our service ensures they capture every lead. Follow up with phone calls offering a demo.

LocalPros Network & Affiliates: Use our lead‑generation sites to generate leads in key verticals. Sell these leads or offer them as proof of concept to upsell Smart Sites. Develop a referral program for consultants and agencies (e.g., 20 % recurring commission).

Trade Groups & Community Sponsorships: Sponsor local chambers of commerce events, join trade associations and host webinars on topics like “How AI Can Double Your Calls.”

Advertising & Creative Strategy

Focus on outcomes: Ads should speak to the prospect’s pain (missed calls, empty schedules) and offer a simple solution (AI‑powered website that answers calls and books jobs). Avoid jargon; use real results (e.g., “50 % more calls” or “Double your bookings”).

Video demos: Short (30‑60 sec) demos showing a call coming in, the AI agent texting back, a customer booking an appointment and a review being collected. Video increases engagement on social platforms.

Lead magnets: Offer a free “Website & Lead Capture Audit” or “5 AI scripts that convert leads.” Capture emails for drip campaigns that educate prospects about the benefits of AI and automation.

Implementation Roadmap (Refined)

Week 1–2: Finalise updated pricing and allowances in GHL. Modify snapshots and checkout forms. Write benefit‑focused copy for home, pricing and plan pages. Gather testimonials and create case study narratives. Set up Supabase tables for content.

Week 3–4: Design and build the new home page and pricing page using the refined structure. Implement tooltips and toggles. Populate the knowledge base for the AI chatbot. Configure analytics and A/B testing.

Week 5–6: Launch the updated marketing site. Deploy ad campaigns in one market (e.g., Phoenix) and measure conversion rates. Onboard the first cohort of customers through the new checkout flow. Refine messaging based on early data.

Week 7–8: Roll out to additional markets. Introduce LocalPros lead‑rental as an upsell to existing customers. Begin outreach through cold email and phone campaigns. Explore partnerships with trade associations.
