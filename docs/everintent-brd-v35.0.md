## Document Purpose

This is the **single source of truth** for EverIntent.com. It governs:

1. What customers buy (T1-T4 tiers, pricing, features)
2. What customers experience (UX flows from ad to purchase to delivery to billing)
3. What the team does (low-LOE provisioning, delivery SOPs)
4. What Lovable builds (marketing site pages, admin portal)
5. What gets configured in GHL + Stripe (SaaS plans, snapshots, billing)
6. What gets built on WordPress (customer sites T1-T4)
7. Go-To-Market execution (channels, niches, ad copy, UTMs)

**Non-goals:** This document does not debate architecture. It specifies requirements and the simplest implementation that meets them.

## ⛔ DESIGN ANTI-PATTERNS — DO NOT USE

**The following sites, styles, and patterns are EXPLICITLY BANNED as design references:**

1. **SmartSites.com (smartsites.com)** — DO NOT reference, copy, or draw inspiration from this site in any way. This includes:
   - Their scattered/floating browser window hero effect
   - Their color schemes (especially yellow/black)
   - Their layout patterns
   - Any visual elements whatsoever

**Why:** We are building our own unique brand identity under **EverIntent**. SmartSites is a large US digital marketing agency with strong common-law trademark rights. We use "smart website(s)" as descriptive product language, NOT as a brand name.

**If you are an AI or developer reading this:** Never suggest SmartSites.com as a reference. Never attempt to recreate their design patterns. Never use "SmartSites" as a brand name or logo lockup. This is a hard rule with no exceptions.

---

**EverIntent** delivers AI automation and smart websites to local service businesses at transparent, affordable prices. AI Employee modes from $497/month, Smart Website tiers from $249 one-time to $497/month recurring, with clear upgrade paths.

**Brand Positioning:** "Stop losing money to missed calls. Let AI handle it."

**Target Market:** Local service businesses across 4 industry categories and 65+ verticals

**Value Proposition:** "We build conversion-focused sites for local service businesses starting at $249. Every site ships upgrade-ready with automation and AI under the hood."

**Product Lines Under EverIntent (v35.1):**
| Product | Description | Entry Point |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **AI Employee** | Managed AI receptionist services (voice, SMS, chat) | Primary revenue driver |
| **Smart Websites** | 4-tier website ladder ($249–$497/mo) | Entry point to ecosystem |
| **Web Chat Only** | Chat automation without voice ($497 setup + $79/mo) | Parallel entry point |
| **Warmy Booster** | Email deliverability add-on ($49/mo) | Add-on to Smart Lead |
| **Legal AI** | Specialized vertical at EverIntentLegalAI.com | Separate microsite |

### 2.2 Anchor Statement (v35.0)

> **The EverIntent AI Employee is a single execution engine — one Voice AI Agent per DID, one global Conversation AI, and per-DID Control Workflows — that produces three canonical proof artifacts (call, SMS, and chat transcripts) across five inbound channels, with behavior determined by rule-based modes rather than separate infrastructure builds.**

This statement governs all architectural decisions. There is **one engine, many behaviors** — not multiple systems.

### 2.3 Product Methodology — Transcript-Validated Conversion (TVC)

The AI Employee proves its value through **real interaction transcripts**, not feature lists or demos.

#### Why Transcripts Win

| Traditional Approach | TVC Approach |
|---------------------|--------------|
| "Our AI can answer calls" | "Here's the transcript where AI recovered a $2,400 job at 11pm" |
| Feature specifications | Proof of value delivered |
| Trust required upfront | Evidence provided first |

#### Canonical Transcripts

Three transcript types anchor all marketing, demos, and proof:

| ID | Transcript Type | Trigger | AI Behavior | Proof Value |
|----|-----------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| T1 | **Missed Call Recovery** | Call missed OR AI hangup <15s | SMS sent → Conversation AI engages | "We recovered this lead you would have lost" |
| T2 | **After-Hours Answering** | Call outside business hours | Voice AI answers, qualifies, books | "We handled this while you slept" |
| T3 | **Front-Line Screening** | Call during business hours | Voice AI answers → optional transfer | "We screened this so you didn't waste time" |

**Web Chat** feeds into the same outcomes (O1-O5), producing chat transcripts as a fourth proof artifact but not a separate canonical transcript type.

## 4. Business Model

### Core Revenue Principles

1. **Revenue at Every Step** - Nothing is free unless it strategically leads to bigger revenue. The sales process itself should make money.
2. **Asset Ownership** - We own domains, phone numbers, rankings, traffic. Customers come and go. Assets stay. This is the moat.
3. **One Tech Stack, Multiple Revenue Paths** - Same WordPress build. Same GHL automations. Different monetization based on the relationship.
4. **Relationship → Trust → MRR** - Every interaction builds toward recurring revenue. The goal is always MRR.

### How Buyers Actually Find Us (Persona-Based)

Local service businesses don't search for "T2 package." They experience **trigger events**:

| Trigger Event | What They Say | What They Search |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| Lost deal to competitor | "Their website looked more professional" | "web design for [industry]" |
| Slow month | "I'm not getting enough calls" | "how to get more leads" |
| Bad review | "My Google rating dropped" | "reputation management" |
| Missed calls | "I can't answer my phone when I'm working" | "missed call text back" |
| Schedule chaos | "I'm double-booked again" | "online booking for [industry]" |

**Key insight:** They search for **products/solutions**, not tier comparisons. This is why industry landing pages (4 category stubs) are planned for Phase 3E.

  ghl_checkout_redirected BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ghl_customer_id TEXT,

);
```

**portfolio:**

```

**Role-based Admin Schema:**
```sql
-- Role enum
CREATE TYPE public.app_role AS ENUM ('admin', 'moderator', 'user');

-- User roles junction table
CREATE TABLE public.user_roles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  role app_role NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),

);

-- Allowed admin emails (for OTP whitelist)
CREATE TABLE public.allowed_admin_emails (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
);

-- Security definer function (bypasses RLS safely)

RETURNS BOOLEAN
LANGUAGE SQL
STABLE
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM public.user_roles
    WHERE user_id = _user_id
      AND role = _role
  )
$;
```

### 15.3 RLS Policies

```sql
-- Enable RLS on role tables
ALTER TABLE public.user_roles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.allowed_admin_emails ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- user_roles: Only admins can view/modify
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage roles" ON public.user_roles
  FOR ALL USING (public.has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));

-- Portfolio: public read, admin write
CREATE POLICY "Portfolio public read" ON portfolio
  FOR SELECT USING (is_active = true);

CREATE POLICY "Portfolio admin full" ON portfolio
  FOR ALL USING (public.has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));

-- Testimonials: public read, admin write  
CREATE POLICY "Testimonials public read" ON testimonials
  FOR SELECT USING (is_active = true);

CREATE POLICY "Testimonials admin full" ON testimonials
  FOR ALL USING (public.has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));

-- Checkout submissions: admin only
CREATE POLICY "Submissions admin only" ON checkout_submissions
  FOR ALL USING (public.has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));
```

### 15.4 Admin Portal

**URL:** /admin

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Admin navigates to `/admin/login`
2. Enters email address
3. Supabase Edge Function `verify-admin-email` checks if email exists in `allowed_admin_emails`
4. If valid, triggers `signInWithOtp()` — magic link sent to email
5. Admin clicks link, redirected to `/admin` with active session
6. All admin routes wrapped in `<AdminGuard>` component that verifies `has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin')`

**Edge Function:** `supabase/functions/verify-admin-email/index.ts`

**Features:**
- `/admin` — Dashboard overview
- `/admin/submissions` — View/export checkout submissions
- `/admin/portfolio` — CRUD portfolio items
- `/admin/testimonials` — CRUD testimonials

**Security:**
- No password storage
- Email OTP only (phishing-resistant)
- Role checked server-side via `has_role()` function
- Admin emails whitelisted in `allowed_admin_emails` table

---

## 16. Sitemap

### 16.1 Product-Category Landing Pages (NEW in v33)

These pages exist for SEO — buyers search "SEO services" not "tier comparison":

| Product Category | URL | Buyer Search Intent |
|------------------|-----|---------------------|
| Web Design | `/services/web-design` | "web design for [industry]" |
| Local SEO | `/services/seo` | "SEO services", "local SEO" |
| Reputation Management | `/services/reputation` | "reputation management", "get more reviews" |
| AI Automation | `/services/ai-automation` | "AI for small business", "AI receptionist" |
| Online Booking | `/services/booking` | "online scheduling", "appointment booking" |

Each product page should:
- Explain what the product does (outcome-focused)
- Show standalone pricing
- Show which packages include this product
- Have its own conversion path

**Note:** Main Services dropdown continues to use benefit-oriented routes (`/get-found-online`, etc.). These product-category pages are additional SEO entry points.

## 17. Navigation Structure

### 17.1 Header Navigation (v35.3)

Navigation uses dropdowns for AI Employee modes and Smart Websites tiers, plus Industries:

**IMPORTANT: Mode Prefix Removal**
- All UI elements (menus, descriptions, mobile nav) must use human-readable names ONLY
- ❌ "M1: After-Hours" → ✅ "After-Hours"

- This applies to Header, Footer, Mobile Nav, and all marketing copy

### 17.3 MVP Route Implementation

**Primary Navigation (Desktop)**

```
[EverIntent Logo + "Web Design AI & Automation"] | Smart Websites ▼ | AI & Automation | Industries ▼ | Solutions ▼ | Pricing | Our Work | About | [Get Started]
```

- "Portfolio" renamed to "Our Work"

**Smart Websites Dropdown:**
1. **Smart Websites** ← renamed from "Beautiful Websites"
2. **Let AI Handle It** ← elevated to position 2

4. Capture More Leads
5. Reputation Management
6. Social Media Management
7. Content Marketing

**AI & Automation:** Single link to `/services/ai-automation`

**Industries Dropdown:**

3. Health & Wellness
4. Automotive Services

**Solutions Dropdown:**
1. For Law Firms → `https://everintentlegalai.com` (external)
2. Future vertical packages
3. InfoTrust and other products

### 17.6 NavHoverMenu Component Specification

Desktop navigation dropdowns use a custom `NavHoverMenu` component with icons and descriptions.

#### Data Structure

```typescript
interface NavHoverItem {
  to: string;              // Route path
  title: string;           // Main text (e.g., "Beautiful Websites")
  description?: string;    // Sub-text line (e.g., "Professional 5-page site")
  icon?: LucideIcon;       // Lucide icon component
  nestedItems?: NavHoverItem[]; // For nested submenus (future)
}
```

#### Icon Implementation

Icons are Lucide React components passed directly in the `icon` property:

```tsx
{item.icon && <item.icon className="h-5 w-5 text-primary shrink-0 mt-0.5" />}
```

- **Color**: `text-primary` (gold/accent color from design system)
- **Size**: `h-5 w-5` (20px)
- **Alignment**: `shrink-0 mt-0.5` (prevents squishing, aligns with first text line)

#### Smart Websites Dropdown Items (Updated v34)

| Title | Description | Icon |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Smart Websites** | Professional smart websites starting at $249 | `Globe` |
| **Let AI Handle It** | AI automation and voice agents | `Bot` |
| Get Found Online | SEO and local search visibility | `Search` |
| Capture More Leads | Lead capture and follow-up | `MessageSquare` |
| Reputation Management | Review automation | `Star` |
| Social Media Management | Social presence management | `Share2` |
| Content Marketing | Blog and content strategy | `FileText` |

### 17.7 Chat Widget & Support Bot

#### Current State: Single Sitewide Widget

The site currently uses a **single GHL chat widget** (`GHL_WIDGET_ID_SALES`) across all routes. This provides a consistent chat experience sitewide and simplifies operations.

#### Future State: Multi-Widget Architecture (Reserved)

The codebase includes infrastructure for route-based widget switching. When multiple chat personas are needed, the following architecture can be activated:

| Widget Type | Secret Name | Route Prefixes | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Sales Bot | `GHL_WIDGET_ID_SALES` | **Default (all routes)** | Sitewide conversion, pricing questions |
| Support Bot | `GHL_WIDGET_ID_SUPPORT` | `/support/*`, `/help/*` | FAQ, support inquiries, data requests |
| Demo Bot | `GHL_WIDGET_ID_DEMO` | `/demo/*` | Feature showcase, capability demonstration |

**Implementation Notes:**
- Widget IDs stored in Supabase secrets (not client-side env vars)
- Edge function `ghl-config` handles route-to-widget mapping
- Frontend `ghlLoader.ts` fetches widget ID from edge function
- Pattern supports adding new widget types without code changes

#### Desktop Chat Button
- Floating button, bottom-right corner
- Fade-up animation on page load (delayed after consent)
- Gated by cookie consent: button hidden until user accepts cookies
- Styled to match EverIntent design system (accent color, primary background)

#### Mobile Chat Access
- Chat integrated into mobile bottom navbar (not floating button)
- Also gated by cookie consent
- Navbar visibility tied to consent state

### 17.8 Legal Pages

#### Route Structure
| Route | Page | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `/legal/privacy` | Privacy Policy | Standard privacy policy |
| `/legal/terms` | Terms of Service | Service terms and conditions |
| `/legal/data-request` | Data Rights | CCPA data request form |
| `/legal/cookies` | Cookie Preferences | Interactive cookie management page |

### CTA Strategy

- **"Get Started"**: Primary marketing CTA, used in header and key conversion points → `/pricing`
- **"Book a Call"**: General site-wide CTA for consultations → `/contact` (not a separate route)
- No `/book-call` route; all "Book a Call" CTAs point to `/contact`

---

## 18. Domain Integration Architecture

### 18.1 Architecture Decision: Manual Domain Purchase

Domain registration is handled **manually** during the onboarding process:

1. Pre-checkout: Customer indicates if they have a domain or need one
2. Post-payment: GHL intake form collects domain preferences
3. During build: Team purchases domain via GHL dashboard or Namecheap (whichever has better pricing)
4. Team configures DNS to point to Plesk hosting

### 18.2 Why Manual (Not API)

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **No API Integration** | No Namecheap API, no static IP costs, no maintenance |
| **Simpler Checkout** | Fewer steps, less friction, higher conversion |
| **Flexibility** | Team can shop best domain price (GHL vs Namecheap vs other) |
| **Lower Technical Risk** | No checkout failures due to domain API issues |
| **Faster MVP** | Ship without complex domain search UI |

### 18.3 Domain Flow

## 19. Go-To-Market Strategy

### 19.1 AI Employee GTM — Transcript-Validated Conversion (v35.0)

EverIntent's go-to-market strategy is anchored around a single, repeatable proof mechanism: **real transcripts generated by the AI Employee in live production scenarios**. These transcripts are not supporting material; they are the primary conversion asset across marketing, sales, demos, and checkout.

**The AI Employee is not sold as software. It is sold as evidence.**

Every part of the business — website copy, ads, outbound outreach, demos, pricing, and checkout — exists to move a prospect from recognizing a problem to seeing themselves inside one of these transcripts.

#### Hero Message (Homepage)

> "While you were sleeping, your AI Employee recovered a $2,400 job."

Immediately followed by the **Missed Call Recovery transcript** as proof.

#### Conversion Paths

| Visitor Intent | Path |
|----------------|------|
| "Show me proof" | View transcript → Browse modes |
| "Let me try" | Demo request → Sales follow-up |
| "I want to buy" | Pricing → Checkout |
| "I have questions" | Chat widget → Conversation AI |

#### Trust Signals

- Transcript embeds (real examples)
- Industry-specific social proof
- "Setup in 48 hours" promise
- Money-back guarantee (if offered)

### 19.2 Product-First Positioning

Products are primary, packages bundle them. Each segment has a primary product they search for:

| Segment | Pain Point | Primary Product | Package Entry | Price |
|---------|------------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| Legitimacy-focused | "I need a professional website" | Web Design | Starter Site (T1) | $249 |
| Lead-focused | "I'm missing calls and leads" | Lead Capture | Lead Booster (T2) | $97/mo |
| Operations-focused | "My schedule is chaos" | Online Booking | Booking & Reputation (T3) | $197/mo |
| Growth-focused | "I want AI to help" | AI Automation | AI Growth (T4) | $497/mo |
| Premium DIY | "I need more than template" | Custom Web + Sprint | **Smart Launch** | $2,500+ |
| Bespoke | "I want fully custom" | Custom Design | Custom | $5,000+ |
| Uncertain | "Not sure what I need" | Discovery | **SmartStart Session** | $500-750 |

### 19.3 Channel Strategy

**Primary Channels:**
1. **Craigslist** - "Services > Computer" in target markets
2. **Facebook** - Local business groups, marketplace
3. **Trade Groups** - Industry-specific forums and associations

### Target Markets (Phase 1)

1. Phoenix, AZ
2. Dallas, TX
3. Houston, TX
4. Atlanta, GA

### Ad Copy Framework

**Headline Pattern:** [Pain Point] + [Solution] + [Price]

**Example:**
```
Need a Website That Actually Gets You Calls?
Professional 5-page site. Built in 5 days. $249.
No monthly fees. You own everything.
→ everintent.com
```

### UTM Structure

```
utm_source=craigslist|facebook|tradegroup
utm_medium=organic|paid|referral
utm_campaign=phoenix-hvac|dallas-roofing|etc
utm_content=ad-variant-a|ad-variant-b
```

### 19.4 Success Metrics (v35.0)

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Setup fee collection rate | >80% of starts complete payment | Stripe data |
| Time to first transcript | <48 hours from setup complete | GHL timestamp |
| Self-service purchase rate | >30% of sales | No sales call tag |
| Transcript demo engagement | >60% scroll depth on homepage | Analytics |
| Mode upgrade rate | >20% within 90 days | GHL pipeline |

## Appendix F: Design System & Component Patterns

### F.0 Design Philosophy & Business Rationale

**Why Our Design Looks This Way:**

EverIntent's design is intentionally modeled after award-winning agency websites (SPINX Digital, Shape, Isadora Agency) that convert visitors into paying customers. The design decisions below are not arbitrary aesthetic choices—they're proven conversion patterns.

| Design Decision | Business Rationale | Research Source |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Dark base with amber accent** | Premium positioning without alienating SMB buyers; dark conveys sophistication, amber signals action | SPINX Digital ($5-50K projects), in-house agency aesthetic |
| **Glassmorphic CTAs** | Creates depth and "floating" effect that draws eye to conversion points; higher click-through than flat buttons | Shape agency pattern; modern SaaS standard |
| **Animated underlines on nav** | Provides feedback without page reload; signals interactivity; reduces perceived friction | UX research on micro-interactions |
| **Mesh gradient backgrounds** | Adds visual interest without distraction; creates atmosphere that feels "designed" not "templated" | Isadora Agency; differentiates from DIY builders |
| **Space Grotesk headings** | Geometric sans-serif reads as modern/tech-forward; differentiates from Inter/default fonts | Contemporary agency standard |
| **Layered shadows** | Creates depth hierarchy; premium feel over flat shadows; guides visual flow | Material Design 3 principles |
| **Amber glow on hover** | Reward for interaction; signals clickability; creates "living" interface | Conversion optimization research |

**The Core Principle:** Every visual choice either builds trust or drives action. If it doesn't do one of these, it shouldn't exist.

### F.1 HSL Color Palette (EverIntent Design System)

### F.2 Font Configuration

```css
/* In index.html <head> */
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Space+Grotesk:wght@500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

/* In index.css */
:root {
  --font-sans: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
  --font-display: 'Space Grotesk', system-ui, sans-serif;
}

/* Usage */
.font-display { font-family: var(--font-display); }
body { font-family: var(--font-sans); }
```

### F.3 Custom Utilities (index.css)

```css
/* Layered shadows for premium depth */
.shadow-layered {
  box-shadow: 
    0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.07),
    0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.07),
    0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.07),

    0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1),
    0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.1),
    0 16px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
}

/* Spring-like transitions */
.transition-spring {
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);
}

/* Background patterns */
.bg-mesh {
  background: 
    radial-gradient(at 40% 20%, hsl(var(--accent) / 0.1) 0px, transparent 50%),
    radial-gradient(at 80% 0%, hsl(var(--primary) / 0.15) 0px, transparent 50%),
    radial-gradient(at 0% 50%, hsl(var(--accent) / 0.05) 0px, transparent 50%);
}

.bg-noise {
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg viewBox='0 0 256 256' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cfilter id='noise'%3E%3CfeTurbulence type='fractalNoise' baseFrequency='0.65' numOctaves='3' stitchTiles='stitch'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Crect width='100%25' height='100%25' filter='url(%23noise)'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");
  opacity: 0.03;
}

/* Nav link with animated underline */
.nav-link {
  @apply relative;

### F.4 Social Share & OG Image Specification

**Primary OG Image:** `public/og-image.jpg` (1200×630)

**Canonical Brand Elements:**
| Element | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| "Ever" | #FFFFFF (white) | Bold weight, left-positioned |
| "Intent" | #A855F7 (vibrant purple) | Bold weight, right of "Ever" |
| Streak | Gradient from #A855F7 → #7878DD | Tapered line below wordmark |
| Tagline | "Web Design & Practical AI" | White, regular weight |
| Background | Deep indigo/navy (#0f1219 → #151a2e) | Neural network visualization overlay |

**⚠️ CRITICAL: AI Image Generation Constraint**

AI image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney, Flux, etc.) **CANNOT reliably render precise brand text**. They will:
- Misspell words
- Use wrong fonts
- Break letter spacing
- Apply incorrect colors

**Correct Workflow for OG Images:**
1. **Never** generate the logo text with AI
2. **Start with** a user-provided logo asset (screenshot from LogoRenderer, Figma export, etc.)
3. **Use AI image editing** to enhance the background around the existing logo
4. The image edit tool preserves the original logo while adding context (neural networks, gradients, particles)

**Example prompt for enhancement (NOT generation):**
> "Place this logo in a stunning dark indigo background with subtle glowing neural network patterns, flowing data streams, and elegant abstract AI visualization. Keep the logo crisp and centered."

**Reference:** The production OG image was created by taking the database-rendered logo (via LogoRenderer) and using AI image editing to add a premium indigo AI-themed backdrop with neural network patterns and geometric crystals.

## Appendix G: Phased Implementation Plan

This appendix documents the staggered implementation approach for design system, cookie consent, and GHL integration. Phases are ordered to isolate external API complexity and enable incremental progress.

### G.1 Phase Overview

| Phase | Scope | Dependencies | Components |
|-------|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Phase 1** | Design System + Footer + Mobile Navbar | None (frontend only) | index.css, tailwind.config.ts, Footer, MobileBottomBar |
| **Phase 2** | Cookie Consent | Phase 1 complete | CookieConsent, App.tsx integration |
| **Phase 3** | GHL v2 Integration | Phase 2 complete + GHL specs locked | ghlLoader, GHLChatWidget, DesktopChatButton, env vars |

## Appendix H: vite-react-ssg Configuration Pattern

> **⚠️ REQUIRED READING**: This appendix documents critical SSG configuration patterns learned through debugging. Any Lovable project using `vite-react-ssg` MUST follow these patterns to avoid hydration errors and build failures.

### H.1 Critical Configuration Files

#### package.json Build Command

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite-react-ssg build"
  }
}
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Build command MUST be `vite-react-ssg build`, NOT `vite build`. This is the most common mistake.

#### vite.config.ts

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc";
import path from "path";
import { componentTagger } from "lovable-tagger";

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({
  server: {
    host: "::",
    port: 8080,
  },
  plugins: [
    react(),
    mode === "development" && componentTagger(),
  ].filter(Boolean),
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
    },
  },
  ssgOptions: {
    script: 'defer',
    formatting: 'minify',
    // Filter routes for pre-rendering - exclude admin routes only
    includedRoutes: (paths: string[]) => {
      return paths.filter(path => !path.startsWith('/admin'));
    },
  },
  // ⚠️ CRITICAL: NO manualChunks configuration
  // manualChunks conflicts with vite-react-ssg's external module handling
}));
```

#### vercel.json

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/admin/:path*", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

**⚠️ NEVER use catch-all rewrite** like:
```json
{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
```
This bypasses ALL pre-rendered static files and causes hydration errors #418/#423 in production.

### H.2 React Component Patterns

#### ClientOnly Wrapper (Required for Portal Components)

Radix UI components (Sheet, Dialog, DropdownMenu, Tooltip, etc.) create portals that cause hydration mismatches during SSG.

```typescript
// src/components/ClientOnly.tsx
import { useState, useEffect, type ReactNode } from 'react';

interface ClientOnlyProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  fallback?: ReactNode;
}

export function ClientOnly({ children, fallback = null }: ClientOnlyProps) {
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true);
  }, []);

  return mounted ? <>{children}</> : <>{fallback}</>;
}
```

#### QueryClient Placement (CRITICAL)

QueryClient MUST be created inside the component, not outside:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Inside component
function RootLayout() {
  const [queryClient] = useState(() => new QueryClient());
  
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {/* ... */}
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}

// ❌ WRONG - Outside component causes state persistence across SSR renders
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {/* ... */}
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

### H.3 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Error | Solution |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| `manualChunks: { vendor: ['react'] }` | "react cannot be included in manualChunks because it is resolved as external" | Remove manualChunks entirely from vite.config.ts |
| Catch-all rewrite `/(.*) → /index.html` | Hydration errors #418/#423 | Use admin-only rewrite: `/admin/:path*` |
| Radix Sheet/DropdownMenu in SSG pages | Hydration mismatches | Use `isMounted` guard or `ClientOnly` wrapper |
| QueryClient outside component | State persistence errors | Create inside component with `useState` |
| Portal components without ClientOnly | Hydration mismatches | Wrap in `ClientOnly` |

### H.4 Verification Checklist

Before deploying, verify:

1. ✅ Build completes with `vite-react-ssg build` (no errors)
2. ✅ `view-source:` on production shows pre-rendered HTML content (not empty SPA shell)
3. ✅ No console hydration errors (#418, #423, or "Text content does not match")
4. ✅ Admin routes still work (SPA fallback via vercel.json)
5. ✅ Portal-based components (toasts, tooltips) function correctly after hydration
