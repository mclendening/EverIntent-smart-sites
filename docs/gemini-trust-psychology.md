# SmartSites - Trust Building & Conversion Context

## UNDERSTANDING THE BUYER

### Who They Are
- Local service business owners (HVAC, plumbers, roofers, electricians, landscapers)
- Usually 35-55 years old
- Making $75K-$250K revenue
- Busy — they're doing the work themselves most days
- Not technical — they fix things, they don't build websites
- Skeptical — they've been burned by marketing people before

### Their Emotional State When They Land
| Surface Thought | Deeper Feeling |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "I need a website" | Embarrassed they don't have a good one |
| "Competitors are getting my leads" | Anxious about losing ground |
| "I don't have time for this" | Overwhelmed by all the options |
| "I've been burned before" | Distrustful of agencies |
| "I can't afford to waste money" | Financially cautious |

### What Makes Them Leave
- Can't find the price (hiding something?)
- Too much jargon (not for me)
- Looks too slick/corporate (out of my league)
- No proof it works (just promises)
- Confusing next steps (too hard)

### What Makes Them Stay
- Price is right there (honest)
- Language they understand (gets me)
- Looks professional but approachable (for people like me)
- Real examples they can check (proof)
- Clear simple path forward (I can do this)

## THE TRUST SEQUENCE

Every visitor goes through this mental checklist. Design the page to answer these in order:

### 1. "Is this for me?" (0-3 seconds)
**What they need to see:**
- Headline that names their situation
- Imagery of people like them (service businesses)
- Not too corporate, not too cheap

**Design implication:** Hero must be immediately clear about who this is for.

### 2. "Can I afford it?" (3-10 seconds)
**What they need to see:**
- Actual price number
- No "contact for pricing" games
- Feels reasonable for what they get

**Design implication:** Price visible in hero or immediately below. Never hidden.

### 3. "Do they know what they're doing?" (10-30 seconds)
**What they need to see:**
- Clean, professional design (proof of competence)
- Real portfolio with live sites
- Specific outcomes, not vague promises

**Design implication:** Portfolio preview early. Links to real sites they can verify.

### 4. "Will I get screwed?" (30-60 seconds)
**What they need to see:**
- "You own everything" (no lock-in)
- Clear timeline (5 days)
- Testimonials from similar businesses
- FAQ that addresses concerns

**Design implication:** Trust signals throughout. Objection handling in FAQ.

### 5. "What do I do now?" (60+ seconds)
**What they need to see:**
- One clear primary CTA
- Simple process (3 steps max)
- Low commitment first step

**Design implication:** CTAs everywhere but not overwhelming. Clear primary action.

## DESIGN FOR TRUST, NOT TRICKS

### Trust-Building Design Choices

**DO:**
- Use real photography (Unsplash, authentic style)
- Show actual portfolio work with live links
- Display specific numbers ($249, 5 days, 500+ sites)
- Use plenty of whitespace (confidence)
- Make pricing transparent and easy to find
- Include human faces (connection)
- Use clear, simple language

**DON'T:**
- Use countdown timers or fake urgency
- Hide pricing behind forms
- Use corporate stock photos
- Overwhelm with animations
- Make claims you can't prove
- Use jargon or buzzwords
- Create artificial scarcity

### The Competence Signal
The website itself is proof of competence. If we're selling websites, ours must be:
- Fast loading
- Mobile perfect
- Easy to navigate
- Beautiful but functional
- Clear and readable

A visitor should think: "If this is what their own site looks like, mine will be good too."

## SECTION-BY-SECTION PURPOSE

### Hero Section
**Job:** Stop the scroll, establish relevance, show price
**Must include:**
- Clear headline about outcome (not features)
- Specific price point ($249)
- Primary CTA
- Supporting image/video that shows real business context

### Problem Section
**Job:** Make them feel understood
**Approach:**
- Name specific pains (not generic struggles)
- Use "you" language
- Keep it brief — 3-4 pain points max
- Don't dwell — acknowledge and move on

**Example pains to name:**
- "Your competitor shows up on Google. You don't."
- "Customers call when you're on a job. They don't leave messages."
- "You paid for a website once. It still looks like 2015."

### Solution Section
**Job:** Show the transformation
**Approach:**
- Outcome-focused, not feature-focused
- Visual icons or imagery for each benefit
- Connect back to the pains you just named

**Example solutions:**
- "Show up when customers search" (solves Google visibility)
- "Text customers back automatically when you miss a call" (solves missed leads)
- "A site you're actually proud to share" (solves embarrassment)

### Tier/Pricing Section
**Job:** Make the decision easy
**Approach:**
- Show all options side-by-side
- Highlight recommended option (T2 as "Most Popular")
- Clear feature differentiation
- CTA on each tier
- No hidden costs

### Social Proof Section
**Job:** Reduce risk perception
**Elements:**
- Portfolio preview (live sites, verifiable)
- Testimonials with photos and business types
- Specific results when possible ("went from 0 to 40 leads/month")

### Final CTA Section
**Job:** Remove all remaining friction
**Elements:**
- Restate value proposition
- Primary CTA (prominent)
- Reassurance copy ("5 days to launch. You own everything.")
- Secondary option (book a call for those not ready)

## MOBILE-FIRST IS THE ONLY WAY

This isn't "also works on mobile." This is "designed for mobile, adapted to desktop."

### The Reality:
- 70%+ of traffic is mobile
- These are tradespeople — they're not at desks
- They're checking between jobs, at lunch, in the truck
- Cellular connection, not WiFi
- Quick decision-making, not deep research sessions

### Design Sequence:
1. **Design for iPhone SE (375px) first**
2. Test every component at that width
3. Then adapt UP to larger screens
4. Desktop is the enhancement, not the baseline

### Mobile UX Requirements:

**Navigation:**
- Hamburger menu (clean, simple)
- Logo + single CTA in header
- Sticky header that hides on scroll down, shows on scroll up
- Bottom nav or sticky CTA for key actions

**Hero Section:**
- Full viewport height on mobile
- Headline + subhead + CTA visible without scroll
- Background image/video optimized for portrait
- CTA button in thumb zone (bottom third)

**Content Sections:**
- Single column always
- Cards stack vertically
- Generous tap targets (44px minimum)
- Swipeable carousels for horizontal content (testimonials, portfolio)
- Accordion for FAQs (not all expanded)

**Forms:**
- One field visible at a time (or minimal fields visible)
- Large input fields (48px height minimum)
- Proper input types (tel, email) for right keyboards
- Sticky submit button
- Inline validation (no page reload)

**Typography:**
- Body text: 16px minimum (prevents iOS zoom)
- Headlines: readable without being cramped
- Line height: 1.5 minimum for body
- Adequate contrast (WCAG AA)

**Images:**
- Lazy load everything below fold
- Proper srcset for responsive images
- WebP with fallbacks
- Compress aggressively — every KB matters on cellular

**Performance Targets:**
- First Contentful Paint: under 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: under 2.5s
- Total page weight: under 1MB
- Works on 3G connections

## MOBILE INTERACTION PATTERNS

### What Works:
- Real tradespeople (not actors)
- On-the-job contexts (trucks, tools, customer homes)
- Phone/tablet usage (running business remotely)
- Clean, well-lit, modern feeling
- Diverse but authentic (not forced)

### Unsplash Search Terms:
- "contractor working"
- "plumber professional"
- "small business owner phone"
- "service technician"
- "handyman truck"
- "electrician work"
- "business owner tablet"
- "hvac technician"

### Video Usage:
- **When to use:** Hero section only, adds context without distraction
- **What to show:** Hands working, phone notifications, service context
- **Specs:** 10-15 seconds, looped, muted, ambient
- **When to skip:** If it slows load time or doesn't add meaning

## MEASURING SUCCESS

The homepage works when:
- Bounce rate under 50%
- Time on page over 90 seconds

- Pricing page click-through over 15%
- Mobile conversion rate matches desktop (±20%)

The pricing page works when:

## FINAL THOUGHT

The best marketing doesn't feel like marketing. It feels like someone finally explaining something clearly.

These business owners don't want to be "marketed to." They want to understand what they're getting, what it costs, and why they should trust you. 

Give them that, and they'll buy.
