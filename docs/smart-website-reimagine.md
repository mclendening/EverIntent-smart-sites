Re‑imagining EverIntent’s Smart Website Offerings for Hyper‑Growth Businesses (Feb 2026)

Current Smart Website tiers and gaps

EverIntent currently offers four Smart Website tiers—Smart Site, Smart Lead, Smart Business and Smart Growth. All tiers include a professional, mobile‑responsive website with SSL, basic SEO, contact form and GA4 analytics. Higher tiers progressively add missed‑call text‑back, an AI chat widget, a CRM/mobile app, online booking, review automation and an AI voice agent. Hosting is included in all monthly plans; Smart Site pays $149/year after the first year.

While the hierarchy introduces automation gradually, several challenges emerge when targeting companies in hyper‑growth mode:
	•	The entry‑level Smart Site is a simple brochure site that may not appeal to fast‑growing firms looking for immediate conversions and real‑time engagement.
	•	The AI voice agent (the talking chat bot) appears only in the highest tier, leaving no middle option for businesses that want conversational AI on the website but don’t yet need full phone automation.
	•	New high‑margin add‑ons—payments, social planning, omnichannel messaging, email deliverability—are not reflected in the current packaging, making cross‑selling cumbersome.
	•	Web and AI Employee product lines share overlapping features (booking, chat, CRM), yet there is no unified path that blends website and AI functionality for companies focused on customer acquisition.

Guiding principles for the re‑design

To serve an ICP of hyper‑growth businesses acquiring new customers, the Smart Website lineup should:
	1.	Be benefits‑driven and outcome‑focused. Each plan should promise a clear ROI: fast launch, lead capture, conversion automation or full AI customer experience.
	2.	Integrate conversation and conversion channels early. AI chat (both text and voice), booking and payment flows should surface before the final tier to maximize lead conversion.
	3.	Align with add‑on packs and AI Employee plans. Packages should make it easy to add payment processing, social posting, omni‑channel inboxes or deliverability services without confusing pricing.
	4.	Preserve high margins while keeping effort low. Leverage GHL’s built‑in features and new add‑on packs (e.g., Get Paid Now, Social Autopilot, Email Authority, Omnichannel Inbox) to provide high perceived value with minimal additional labor.
	5.	Provide a bridge to phone automation. Create an intermediate AI plan that offers website and chat automation without full call handling, making the transition to AI Employee smoother.

Integration of Add‑On Packs

Each Smart Website plan should have a clear path to add‑on packs rather than listing individual GHL features. The packs recommended earlier can be integrated as follows:
	•	Email Authority (Warmy + Dedicated Domain/IP) → Included starting at Lead or Conversion plans. Offered as an upgrade for Launch.
	•	Get Paid Now (Text2Pay, proposals & e‑sign) → Included in Conversion and above; optional for Lead.
	•	Social Autopilot (social planner + templates) → Included in Scale; optional for Conversion and Growth AI.
	•	Omnichannel Inbox (WhatsApp, FB/IG DMs, Google Business Chat) → Optional for Conversion; included in Growth AI.
	•	One‑time campaigns (Pipeline Revival, Review Blitz) → Presented as quick‑win services on the Services/Add‑Ons page. Use strong benefit headlines (e.g., “Wake up your dead leads in a weekend”) and limited availability to drive urgency.

By bundling features into packs, the website can present fewer, more powerful add‑on options, avoiding the “laundry list” effect while keeping margins high.

Seamless Site Experience

To avoid overwhelming clients and ensure consistent cross‑selling:
	1.	Unified navigation: Rename “Smart Websites” to “Smart Sites” and “AI Employee” to “AI Plans” to reduce jargon. Add an Add‑Ons or Services link in the main nav, replacing “Contact.”
	2.	Configurable pricing pages: Allow visitors to toggle between website and AI plans and add desired packs via checkboxes. As they select options, show monthly/one‑time totals and highlight the value (e.g., “Omnichannel Inbox adds live chat via WhatsApp & FB Messenger”).
	3.	Contextual cross‑sell blocks: On each plan page, include a section “Power up your site” with recommended add‑ons based on the plan. On AI plan pages, include “Upgrade your website” suggestions.
	4.	Clear upgrade paths: Use language like “Start with Lead and upgrade anytime” and provide upgrade CTAs at the bottom of each plan’s feature list.
	5.	Benefit‑driven storytelling: For each plan and add‑on, lead with the outcome (“Get paid faster,” “Never miss a lead,” “Be everywhere your customers are”) rather than the technical feature name. Supplement with simple metrics (e.g., 30% more leads captured, 5‑min average response time).

Conclusion

To capture hyper‑growth customers, the Smart Website lineup should evolve from static tiers into a flexible platform that blends AI chat/voice, booking and payments at earlier stages, with optional add‑on packs for messaging, social and deliverability. Introducing a Conversion Plan and an AI Chat Plan bridges the gap between the current Smart Website tiers and the full AI Employee phone automation, ensuring that every company—whether launching, scaling or going all‑in on AI—can find a concise, high‑impact package that meets its growth goals.
