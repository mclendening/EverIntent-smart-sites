# SmartSites Packaging & Market Alignment Research

**Author:** Independent Analysis (Lovable)  
**Date:** December 19, 2025  
**Purpose:** Identify structural gaps in current service packaging that may be leaving money on the table, particularly in the $5-12k range.

## Executive Finding: The Missing Middle

The current BRD has a **bifurcated structure** that creates a revenue gap:

| Current Structure | Price Point | Revenue Model |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| T1 Smart Site | $249 one-time | Loss-leader |
| T2-T4 | $97-$497/mo | MRR upsell |
| Custom Design | $5,000+ one-time | Bespoke |

**The Problem:** There's no clear bridge between "productized SaaS tiers" ($97-497/mo) and "custom agency work" ($5k+). This gap means:

1. Customers who need more than T4 but less than full custom fall through
2. The sales process doesn't capture project-based revenue naturally
3. Traditional agency revenue (retainer + project hybrids) is absent

ChatGPT's analysis validated the existing tier structure but failed to identify that **traditional agencies make the majority of their revenue from project-based work + retainers**, not pure SaaS subscriptions.

## Research Finding #1: How Local Businesses Actually Buy

**Source:** Forrester "State of Business Buying 2024", Gartner B2B Buying Journey

Local businesses don't buy websites. They buy **outcomes**:

| What They Say | What They Mean | Buying Trigger |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| "I need a website" | "I need to look legitimate" | Lost a deal to a competitor with better presence |
| "I need leads" | "I'm not getting enough calls" | Revenue pressure |
| "I need to rank on Google" | "My competitors show up, I don't" | Competitive anxiety |
| "I need help with marketing" | "I don't know what to do" | Overwhelm/time poverty |

**Key Insight:** The decision is usually triggered by a **negative event** (lost deal, slow month, competitor embarrassment), not proactive planning. This means:

- Pain-first messaging is correct (ChatGPT got this right)
- But the **solution packaging** must match the **problem scope**, not just the budget

---

## Research Finding #2: The Retainer Gap

**Source:** SPP.co Agency Research, AgencyAnalytics Pricing Report 2025

Traditional agencies use 3 revenue models:

| Model | Use Case | Margin |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Project-based** | Website builds, one-time campaigns | 40-60% |
| **Retainer** | Ongoing marketing, SEO, management | 60-80% |
| **Hybrid** | Project upfront + retainer ongoing | Highest LTV |

The current SmartSites structure is:
- **T1:** Project (loss-leader)
- **T2-T4:** Retainer (SaaS MRR)
- **Custom:** Project only

**What's Missing:** A **hybrid model** where project work naturally converts to retainer revenue.

### The Traditional Agency Playbook (What SmartSites Doesn't Do Yet)

1. **Discovery/Strategy Project** ($1,500-$3,000): Paid engagement to define scope
2. **Build Project** ($5,000-$15,000): Website, branding, initial campaigns
3. **Management Retainer** ($500-$2,000/mo): Ongoing SEO, ads, content

This creates 3 revenue events from one customer vs. SmartSites' current 2 (T1 → T2-T4 upgrade).

---

## Research Finding #3: The $5-12k Custom Gap

**Source:** WebFX Pricing Packages, White Label Agency Pricing Guide

The "custom design from $5,000" positioning is problematic:

1. **No middle option**: Customer needs exceed T4 but don't justify $5k+ custom
2. **Scope ambiguity**: "$5,000+" means nothing—what's included?
3. **No productized custom**: Every custom project is bespoke (high LOE, low margin)

### What High-Performing Agencies Do Instead

They create **productized premium packages** between SaaS tiers and full custom:

| Package | Price | Includes | Margin |
|---------|-------|----------|--------|
| **Growth Package** | $2,500-$4,000 | Enhanced website (10+ pages) + 3-month marketing sprint | 50-60% |
| **Launch Package** | $5,000-$8,000 | Custom design + SEO foundation + 6-month retainer | 55-65% |
| **Scale Package** | $10,000-$15,000 | Full rebrand + website + ongoing management (12mo commitment) | 60-70% |

These are **still productized** (defined deliverables, fixed price) but capture the "I need more than a template but can't afford $15k custom" market.

---

## Research Finding #4: The Service Page Problem

Current services on the site:
- Beautiful Websites
- Get Found Online  
- Never Miss a Lead
- Book More Jobs
- Run From Your Phone
- Build Your Reputation
- Let AI Handle It

**Problem:** These are **features/capabilities**, not **service offerings**.

### What Traditional Agencies List as Services

| Agency Service | What It Includes | Pricing Model |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Web Design | Discovery, design, development, launch | Project |
| SEO | Audit, optimization, content, links | Monthly retainer |
| PPC/Ads | Setup, management, optimization | Monthly retainer + ad spend |
| Social Media | Strategy, content, posting, engagement | Monthly retainer |
| Reputation Management | Monitoring, review generation, response | Monthly retainer |
| Branding | Logo, brand guidelines, collateral | Project |

**The Gap:** SmartSites bundles everything into tier-based packages, which is efficient for delivery but **obscures value** for buyers who think in service categories.

When a business owner searches "I need SEO," they expect to find an SEO service page, not a tier comparison.

---

## Research Finding #5: The Upsell Architecture Problem

Current upsell path: T1 → T2 → T3 → T4 → Custom

**Issues:**

1. **Linear progression assumes linear needs**: Most businesses don't need "more of everything"—they need **specific things** (e.g., more SEO, more ads, more booking)
2. **No à la carte**: Customer on T2 who just wants AI Voice has to upgrade to T4
3. **No expansion revenue**: Usage-based revenue (SMS, AI minutes) is included in tiers, not sold separately

### What GHL SaaS Agencies Do Differently

**Source:** GoHighLevel Masterclass, GHL Expert Team

Top GHL agencies structure pricing as:

| Base Platform | Add-On Services | Usage |
|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| $97-$297/mo platform access | SEO ($500/mo), Ads ($500/mo), Content ($300/mo) | SMS, AI, calls billed at cost + margin |

This creates **3 revenue levers** instead of 1:
1. Platform MRR (guaranteed)
2. Service add-ons (high margin)
3. Usage revenue (scales with success)

---

## Structural Recommendations

### 1. Add a "Bridge" Tier Between T4 and Custom

**"Smart Launch" Package: $2,500-$4,500 one-time + $297/mo ongoing**

- 10-page custom-designed website (not template)
- Brand photography consultation
- Google Business Profile optimization
- 90-day marketing sprint (SEO + ads setup)
- Includes T3 features ongoing

This captures the "$5k seems too much but T4 isn't enough" segment.

### 2. Create Service-Specific Landing Pages

In addition to tier-based pricing, create pages for:

- `/services/seo` - SEO offering (ties to T3+)
- `/services/web-design` - Website offering (ties to T1-T4 + Custom)
- `/services/reputation-management` - Reputation offering (ties to T3+)
- `/services/ai-automation` - AI offering (ties to T4)

These pages can still funnel to tiers but match how buyers search.

### 3. Unbundle Add-On Services

Create à la carte add-ons available to any tier:

| Add-On | Price | Availability |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| SEO Sprint (3-month) | $1,500 one-time | Any tier |
| Google Ads Management | $500/mo + ad spend | T2+ |
| Content Package (4 blog posts/mo) | $400/mo | Any tier |
| Additional AI Voice Minutes | $0.15/min | T4 only |
| Additional Locations | $97/mo each | T2+ |

This increases revenue without forcing tier upgrades.

### 4. Add a Discovery/Strategy Offering

**"SmartStart Strategy Session": $500-$750**

- 60-min consultation
- Website/marketing audit
- Competitive analysis
- Custom recommendation report
- Credit toward any package purchase

This creates a paid qualification step that:
- Filters serious buyers from tire-kickers
- Generates revenue from the sales process
- Provides natural upsell opportunity

## What ChatGPT Got Right

1. ✅ Benefit-led messaging over feature lists
2. ✅ Pain-first headline structure
3. ✅ AI adoption statistics as differentiator
4. ✅ Subscription model advantages for SMBs
5. ✅ Price anchoring (show T4 first)

## What ChatGPT Missed

1. ❌ The "missing middle" between T4 and Custom
2. ❌ Service-category landing pages (SEO, Ads, etc.)
3. ❌ À la carte add-on revenue stream
4. ❌ Paid discovery/strategy offering
5. ❌ The retainer + project hybrid model
6. ❌ Usage-based revenue as separate line item

---

## Revenue Impact Estimate

| Current Model | Revenue Events |
|---------------|----------------|
| T1 → T2 upgrade | 2 events (one-time + MRR) |
| T1 → T4 upgrade | 2 events |
| T1 → Custom | 2 events (one-time + possible retainer) |

| Proposed Model | Revenue Events |
|----------------|----------------|
| Discovery → Smart Launch → T3 + Add-ons | 4+ events |
| T1 → Add-on services → Usage expansion | 3+ events |
| SEO lead → T3 + SEO add-on + Usage | 3+ events |

**Conservative Estimate:** 30-50% increase in average customer LTV by capturing project revenue and add-on services.

---

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate (no code):** Add "Smart Launch" bridge package to pricing page
2. **Near-term:** Create service-specific landing pages (SEO, Web Design, Reputation)
3. **Medium-term:** Build add-on service checkout flow
4. **Longer-term:** Implement discovery/strategy session booking + credit system
