# EverIntent Smart Sites — Independent Research & Strategic Alignment

**Date:** December 19, 2025  
**Purpose:** Counter-analysis to ChatGPT's BRD recommendations. This document challenges the current tier-bundle approach and proposes a fundamentally different packaging strategy based on independent market research.

---

## Executive Summary: The Problem with the Current Approach

After reviewing the ChatGPT recommendations and conducting independent research, I've identified a critical misalignment:

**ChatGPT's approach bundles features into tiers.** This is classic SaaS thinking.

**Local service businesses don't buy tiers.** They buy outcomes. They buy time back. They buy "someone else handles this."

The current 5-tier structure (Starter → Lead Booster → Booking & Reputation → AI Growth → Custom) creates cognitive overload. Research consistently shows that **3 tiers convert better than 4+** (source: Monetizely pricing psychology research). More importantly, the tier names describe *what they get*, not *what changes for their business*.

## Part 1: What Local Business Owners Actually Buy (And Why)

### The Core Truth: They're Buying Time, Not Software

Research from Constant Contact (2024) reveals:
- **63% of small businesses** struggle to market effectively due to limited time
- **Low confidence** in their ability to execute marketing correctly
- **Lack of knowledge** about what actually works

This isn't a "I need AI chatbot minutes" problem. This is a "I don't have time to deal with this, make it go away" problem.

### The 5 Real Pain Points (Ranked by Urgency)

Based on buyer psychology research and home services marketing studies:

| Pain Point | Urgency | What They Say | What They Mean |
|------------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Missed calls = lost jobs** | CRITICAL | "I can't answer when I'm on a job" | "Someone else needs to handle my phone" |
| **No online presence** | HIGH | "People can't find me" | "I look unprofessional compared to competitors" |
| **No reviews** | HIGH | "Customers say they'll leave one but don't" | "I don't know how to ask without being pushy" |
| **Scheduling chaos** | MEDIUM | "I'm double-booked or have gaps" | "I need a system that works without me thinking about it" |
| **Marketing confusion** | LOW | "I don't know what to post" | "I don't want to think about marketing at all" |

**Critical insight:** The top pain points are about CAPTURE (not losing what comes to you) rather than GROWTH (getting more). This should inform tier positioning.

---

## Part 2: Why the Current Tier Structure Won't Convert

### Problem 1: Too Many Choices

The ChatGPT BRD proposes 5 plans:
- Starter Site ($299 one-time)
- Lead Booster ($199/mo)
- Booking & Reputation ($299/mo)
- AI Growth ($499/mo)
- Custom Design ($5,000+)

Research on pricing psychology (Monetizely, 2025):
> "Three tiers hit the psychological sweet spot. Two feels limited; four or more triggers decision paralysis."

The "decoy effect" works best with exactly 3 options where the middle tier is the obvious choice.

### Problem 2: Feature-Focused Naming

Current tier names describe WHAT you get:
- "Lead Booster" → What's a lead booster? Sounds like software.
- "Booking & Reputation" → Two things in one name. Confusing.
- "AI Growth" → Buzzword soup.

**What converts:** Outcome-focused naming that mirrors how customers describe their goals:
- "Never Miss a Call"
- "Book More Jobs"
- "Run on Autopilot"

### Problem 3: The One-Time vs Subscription Split Creates Friction

Having a $299 one-time entry point alongside $199+/mo subscriptions creates a mental barrier:
- "If I can get a site for $299, why would I pay $199/month?"
- Forces sales to constantly justify the value gap
- Creates price anchoring that works AGAINST the subscription model

**Better approach:** Eliminate the one-time option entirely OR position it as "DIY hosting" that explicitly excludes all the good stuff.

---

## Part 3: The "Productized Service" Alternative

### What's Working for Agencies Right Now

Research into successful productized services reveals a pattern:

| Service | Model | Why It Works |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| **GMB Gorilla** | $400/mo flat | One thing, done completely |
| **100 Pound Social** | £100-255/mo | Predictable output (3-5 posts/week) |
| **Vidpros** | $1,000-4,000/mo | Dedicated hours, not "unlimited" |
| **WP Speed Fix** | $495-2,495 one-time | Problem solved, move on |

**Pattern:** The most successful productized services do ONE thing exceptionally well, with transparent deliverables.

### The GHL Reseller Model Reality

GoHighLevel SaaS mode research (2025):

| GHL Plan | Your Cost | Typical Markup | Your Price Range |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Starter ($97/mo) | $97 | 2-3x | $197-297/mo |
| Unlimited ($297/mo) | $297 | 1.5-2x | $447-597/mo |
| SaaS Pro ($497/mo) | $497 | 1.5-2x | $747-997/mo |

**Critical insight:** Most GHL resellers struggle because they're selling "access to GHL features" instead of "problems solved using GHL."

The winning play isn't to list GHL features in tiers. It's to hide GHL entirely and sell outcomes.

---

## Part 4: A Radically Different Packaging Strategy

### The "Done For You" Approach

Instead of feature tiers, package by SERVICE LEVEL:

| Package | Price | What They Get | Positioning |
|---------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Site Only** | $99/mo | WordPress site, hosting, updates. That's it. | "For businesses who just need to exist online" |
| **Capture Everything** | $297/mo | Site + AI chat + missed call text-back + CRM | "Never lose another lead to a missed call" |
| **Full Autopilot** | $597/mo | Everything above + booking + review automation + AI voice | "Your business runs while you work" |

**Custom builds:** Don't list as a tier. Make it a separate "Enterprise" conversation. "Starting at $5,000."

### Why This Works Better

1. **3 tiers, not 5** — Reduces decision paralysis
2. **Outcome-focused names** — "Capture Everything" beats "Lead Booster"
3. **Clear value ladder** — Each tier solves an ADDITIONAL problem, not a different feature set
4. **Psychological pricing** — $297 middle tier looks reasonable next to $597
5. **$99 entry point** — Low enough to capture budget-conscious buyers, positions against DIY alternatives

### The Pricing Psychology

Using the decoy effect:
- **$99** = "Too basic, I need more"
- **$297** = "This solves my real problem" ← Target tier
- **$597** = "Aspirational, maybe later"

The $99 tier exists primarily to make $297 feel like the smart choice.

## Part 5: Website Structure Recommendations

### What Should NOT Be on the Pricing Page

ChatGPT's recommendation of detailed feature matrices with checkmarks is the classic SaaS playbook. This works for software buyers comparing Slack vs Teams.

**Local service business owners don't read feature matrices.** They skim, look for a number, and decide if it feels expensive.

### What SHOULD Be on the Pricing Page

1. **Headline that addresses the #1 pain** — "Stop Losing Jobs to Missed Calls"
2. **3 cards, each with ONE big benefit** — Not 15 feature bullets
3. **Social proof under each tier** — "Joe's Plumbing went from 20 to 45 jobs/month"
4. **FAQ that handles objections** — "What if I'm not tech savvy?"
5. **Single CTA per tier** — "Get Started" or "Talk to Us"

### Where Tiers Should Appear (And NOT Appear)

| Page | Show Tiers? | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Home Page | Teaser only | "Plans from $99/mo" — Don't overwhelm |
| Pricing Page | Full detail | This is where buyers compare |
| Product Pages | NO | Each product page should sell ONE outcome |
| Checkout | Selected tier only | Reduce cognitive load |

**ChatGPT recommended tier-specific product pages.** I disagree. Product pages should sell benefits (like "Never Miss a Lead"), not plans. The pricing page handles plan comparison.

---

## Part 6: Messaging Framework

### The Hierarchy of Messages

Based on buyer psychology research, messages should follow this pattern:

1. **Pain Agitation** — "You're losing $2,000/month to missed calls"
2. **Credibility** — "We've helped 500+ contractors"
3. **Mechanism** — "Our AI answers every call in 2 seconds"
4. **Proof** — "Mark doubled his bookings in 60 days"
5. **Offer** — "Start at $99/mo"
6. **Risk Reversal** — "Cancel anytime. No contracts."

### What to STOP Saying

| Current Messaging | Problem | Better Alternative |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------|
| "AI-powered automation" | Buzzword, unclear value | "Answers your phone 24/7" |
| "CRM and pipeline" | Technical jargon | "See every lead in one place" |
| "30 AI minutes/month" | Confusing metric | "Handles ~100 conversations/month" |
| "5-page WordPress site" | Commodity description | "Professional website in 5 days" |

### What to START Saying

- "You do the work. We handle the rest."
- "Your phone answered. Your schedule filled. Your reviews growing."
- "Look like a $1M company on a small business budget."
- "No tech skills needed. We set everything up."

## Part 7: Competitive Positioning

### The Real Competition

Local service businesses are NOT comparing EverIntent to other GHL resellers. They're comparing to:

1. **Doing nothing** — "I've survived without a website this long"
2. **DIY options** — Wix, Squarespace, GoDaddy
3. **Nephew who does websites** — The $500 family discount
4. **Local marketing agencies** — $1,500-3,000/mo retainers

### Positioning Against Each

| Competitor | Their Weakness | Our Message |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Doing nothing | Missing revenue | "Your competitors are getting your customers" |
| Wix/DIY | Time sink, looks amateur | "Pro site in 5 days. You do nothing." |
| Nephew discount | No ongoing support | "Who's answering your calls at 2am?" |
| Local agencies | Expensive, overpromise | "Same results. Half the price. No contracts." |

---

## Part 8: Upsell & Expansion Revenue

### The Real Money: Usage-Based Expansion

Instead of trying to upsell from $297 → $597 (hard sell), focus on:

1. **SMS overage** — "You used 500 SMS this month. Add 500 more for $25?"
2. **AI voice minutes** — "Your AI handled 50 calls. Upgrade for more capacity?"
3. **Additional locations** — "$100/mo per location"
4. **Add-on services** — Paid blog posts, video content, Google Ads management

### The LocalPros Network

ChatGPT mentioned this but buried it. This should be a MAJOR revenue stream:
- Lead rental model: $297-497/mo per contractor
- You own the leads, rent them out
- Multiple contractors can buy the same lead (first-come-first-served model)

This is recurring revenue that doesn't require selling more software.

---

## Part 9: Go-To-Market Adjustments

### What ChatGPT Got Right

- Craigslist/classifieds for hyper-local targeting
- Cold outreach via email and phone
- Trade group partnerships

### What's Missing

1. **Referral Program** — Pay existing customers $100 for referrals. Home services contractors talk to each other.

2. **Warranty Card Inserts** — Partner with suppliers (HVAC units, plumbing fixtures). When a unit is installed, the customer gets a card: "Get more customers. Visit EverIntentSmartSites.com"

3. **Supplier Co-Marketing** — Equipment distributors want their contractors to succeed. Offer white-label or co-branded sites.

4. **Video Testimonials > Written** — Contractors trust video. One 60-second video of a plumber saying "I got 15 more jobs last month" beats 50 written reviews.

5. **Demo Environment** — Let prospects click through a real AI chat, hear a real AI voice call. "See it working before you buy."

## Part 10: Immediate Action Items

### For the Marketing Site (This Week)

1. **Reduce tiers from 5 to 3** — Site Only / Capture Everything / Full Autopilot
2. **Rewrite tier names** — Outcome-focused, not feature-focused
3. **Remove feature matrices** — Replace with benefit statements + proof
4. **Add video testimonial section** — Even one video beats paragraphs
5. **Simplify CTAs** — One button per tier: "Get Started"

### For Pricing (This Week)

1. **Kill the $299 one-time option** — Or rebrand as "Self-Hosted" with explicit limitations
2. **Set $297 as the anchor** — Design the pricing page to push people here
3. **Add usage-based expansion** — SMS packs, AI minutes, locations

### For Messaging (This Week)

1. **Homepage headline** — Pain-focused: "Stop Losing Jobs to Missed Calls"
2. **Remove jargon** — No "AI minutes," no "pipeline," no "CRM"
3. **Add calculator** — "How many calls do you miss per week? That's $X lost."
